ou are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

1st approach was which was wrong=>> 
for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
//if previous elemnet is less than the current elemtns simply return curr elemtns as this is max profit
            if(a[i-1]<a[i]){
                return a[i];
        }
        return 0;
}


dry run on =>
1.[7,1,5,3,6,4]  o/p=>5
2.[1,2] o/p=>1
3.[7,6,5,4,1] o/p=>0
4.[2,1,2,0,1,2] o/p=>2

ques is asking=> 
1.max profit means look into the past where lowest price stock is availble and look in future where max price of this stock is availble so simply sell on that 
but return in output max profilt by doing=> max profit=(buy stock price- sell stock price)

2nd approach=>
int maxProfit(vector<int>& a) {
        int n=a.size();
        int k=0;
        int mn=INT_MAX,mx=INT_MIN,mxprofit=0;
        for(int i=1;i<n;i++){

//getting the previous stock value at less price
            if(a[i-1]<a[i]){
                if(a[i-1]<mn){
// storing lowest price stock value
                    mn=a[i-1];
//storing highest
                    mx=a[i];
                }
                mx=max(a[i],mx);
                k=mx-mn;
            }

// storing maxprofit by looking into future 
            mxprofit=max(k,mxprofit);
        }
        return mxprofit;
    }


3rd approch in discussion=>
{
        int lsf = Integer.MAX_VALUE; // least so far
        int op = 0; // overall profit
        int pist = 0; // profit if sold today
        
        for(int i = 0; i < prices.length; i++){
            if(prices[i] < lsf){ // if we found new buy value which is more smaller then previous one
                lsf = prices[i]; // update our least so far
            }
            pist = prices[i] - lsf; // calculating profit if sold today by, Buy - sell
            if(op < pist){ // if pist is more then our previous overall profit
                op = pist; // update overall profit
            }
        }
        return op; // return op
